Various configs and themes from my computer.



F.A.Q.
--------------
- How do I load the gnome terminal colorscheme?

  Put in your home folder and run 
  gconftool-2 --load gnome-terminal-conf.xml
  
- Firefox looks really bad and is buggy after using the css.

  Right click and uncheck menu bar, navigation toolbar and customize to remove the back, foward, home, download and any     other thing that looks out of place buttons. (To enter a web adress press crtl l) 

- How come the 4chan css isn't working properly?

  Most likley because you don't have 4chan X installed.



Known Issues
--------------
- A certain part of the GTK theme is still blue for some reason. I have no idea how to fix it I'm not very experienced with GTK.
- My firefox css is still pretty buggy.
